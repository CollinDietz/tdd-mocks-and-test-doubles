# When And How To Use

---

# When To Use

- When you want to be very strict about behavior in tests
  - When you care more about behavior then data
- When interacting with a complicated interface

<br>

More Specifically
- If there is only a mock available
  - If making a test double was easier it would be done already
- When working with things that aren't:
  - DataSource + Erds
  - Inputs, Outputs, InputOutputs, DigitalInputs
