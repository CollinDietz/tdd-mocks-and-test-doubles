## Slides

https://collindietz.github.io/mermaid-slides/

## Features

- Deploys to GitHub Pages on push
- Uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for dependency management
  - Note that in some cases for some reason slidev is not compatible with pnpm so you need to run `pnpm install --shamefully-hoist`
- Generates a directory index for the slides
